# Finance and Supply Chain Analytics
## Project Overview
This project showcases my proficiency in SQL through a comprehensive analysis of finance and supply chain data. Using MySQL Workbench, I conducted an in-depth examination of complex datasets to extract meaningful insights that can drive strategic decisions. The project demonstrates my ability to apply advanced SQL techniques, including:

1) Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
2) Aggregate Functions
3) Joins
4) Window Functions
5) Subqueries
These techniques were used to derive critical insights that are vital for informed decision-making in finance and supply chain management.

## Analytical Insights and Visualizations
### Unveiling Business Performance Through Data
In this section, I present the key findings and visualizations generated from my SQL analysis. Each insight is accompanied by screenshots, demonstrating the analytical process and results that reveal significant trends and patterns within the data.

## Database Schema Overview

1) A clear understanding of the database structure is the foundation of any data analysis. Below is the schema used in the project, highlighting the relationships between primary tables such as dim_customer, dim_date, and fact_sales_monthly. This schema allowed for efficient querying and data manipulation.
## Top Customer Contribution Analysis

1) Identifying the key customers who drive the majority of sales is crucial for targeted marketing and customer retention strategies. This analysis calculates the percentage contribution of each customer to the total sales for a specific period, providing insights into the most valuable customers.
## Product Pricing and Profitability

1) Pricing strategy is a critical component of profitability. This query examines the gross price per item, enabling an evaluation of product profitability. Understanding which products yield the highest margins helps in optimizing pricing strategies.
## Fiscal Year Sales Performance

1) Analyzing sales performance across different fiscal years helps in identifying trends and shifts in product demand. This analysis provides a breakdown of sales by fiscal year, revealing growth patterns and potential areas for improvement.
## Comprehensive Sales Performance Analysis

1) This multi-join query brings together data from several tables to assess sales performance by product and customer, considering factors such as discounts and promotional activities. The result is a holistic view of sales dynamics within the business.
## Seasonal Demand Trends

1) Sales often fluctuate with seasons, holidays, and other temporal factors. This analysis focuses on identifying seasonal trends in sales, which can be critical for inventory management and marketing campaigns.
## Monthly Sales Trends

1) Understanding sales on a month-to-month basis is essential for short-term planning and forecasting. This analysis provides a detailed breakdown of monthly sales, highlighting patterns and anomalies.
## Year-Over-Year Product Analysis

1) By examining sales data across different years, this analysis identifies products that consistently perform well and those that have gained or lost popularity over time. This insight is vital for product portfolio management.
## Customer Purchasing Patterns

1) A deep dive into customer behavior reveals purchasing patterns, frequency, and product preferences. This analysis helps in tailoring marketing efforts and improving customer satisfaction.
## Conclusion
This Finance and Supply Chain Analytics project underscores my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights. By leveraging advanced SQL techniques, I have extracted valuable information that can guide strategic decision-making in areas such as customer relationship management, pricing strategy, and inventory optimization.
